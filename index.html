    <p id="p1">Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), better known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist,
    essayist, journalist and critic whose work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism
    and outspoken support of democratic socialism.
</p>
    <p id="p3">
         Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction and polemical journalism. He is best known for the allegorical novella
       <span class="books">Animal Farm (1945)</span>  and the dystopian novel <span class="books">Eighty-Four (1949)</span>. His non-fiction works, including 
       <span class="books">The Road to Wigan Pier (1937)</span>, documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England; and Homage to Catalonia (1938), an
        account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, are widely acclaimed as are his essays on politics, literature, language
        and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of <span class="awards">"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".</span>
    </p>
<p id="p2">Orwell's work continues to influence popular and political culture and the term "Orwellian"—descriptive of totalitarian or
authoritarian social practices—has entered the language together with many of his neologisms, including :
